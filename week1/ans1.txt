1. $ man -k your_key_word

2. $ echo $PATH: get the path of executable program: /usr/local/cs/bin 
     /usr/bin /usr/local/bin
   $ find /usr/local/cs/bin /usr/bin /usr/local/bin -name cp
   $ find /usr/local/cs/bin /usr/bin /usr/local/bin -name wc

3. $ which cp
   /usr/local/cs/bin/cp
   $ which wc
   /usr/local/cs/bin/wc

4. $ which emacs
   got: /usr/local/cs/bin/emacs
   cd /usr/local/cs/bin
   ls -la
   found that: emacs -> ../emacs-25.2/bin/emacs-25.2
   (can also use readlink)

5. $ man chmod
   g+s means group adds the permission of "set user or group ID on execution"
   o-x means taking away other users' permission of executing the file

6. $ man find
   find / -mtime -21

7. $ man find
   find / -mtime -21 -type d

8. $ which find
   we get /usr/bin/find
   $ cd /usr/bin/
   $ find /usr/bin/ -type l
   then i copy and paste into a txt file to count

9. $ man ls
   $ cd /usr/lib
   $ ls -la --sort=time
   -rwxr-xr-x   1 root root   18692 Jan 26  2014 libgpg-error.so.0.10.0

10. man locale
    "locale displays the current locale settings for each locale category, 
    based on the settings of 
    the environment  variables  that  control  the  locale"
	$ locale
    LANG, LC_CTYPE, LC_NUMERIC, LC_TIME, LC_COLLATE, LC_MONETARY, LC_MESSAGES,
    LC_PAPER, LC_NAME
    LC_ADDRESS, LC_TELEPHONE, LC_MEASUREMENT, LC_IDENTIFICATION


11.	$ emacs
    C-h r
    C-s sort
	‘M-x sort-lines’ ‘M-x sort-paragraphs’ 
  ‘M-x sort-pages’ ‘M-x sort-fields’
	‘M-x sort-numeric-fields’ ‘M-x sort-columns’
  ‘M-x rmail-sort-by-date’ 
  ‘M-x rmail-sort-by-subject’
	‘M-x rmail-sort-by-author’ ‘M-x rmail-sort-by-recipient’ 
  ‘M-x rmail-sort-by-correspondent’ 
	‘M-x rmail-sort-by-lines’ ‘M-x rmail-sort-by-labels <RET> LABELS <RET>’

12. C-h ? to learn about how to get help
    C-h k to get the document of keys
    I found:
	‘C-M-a’ Move to beginning of current or preceding 
   defun (‘beginning-of-defun’).
	‘C-M-b’ Move backward over a balanced expression (‘backward-sexp’).
	‘C-M-c’ Exit another recursiveediting level, and so on.
	'C-M-d' Move forward down one level of parentheses.down-list
	'C-M-e' Move forward to next end of defun.
	'C-M-f' Move point forward ARG words (backward if ARG is negative).
	'C-M-h' Put point at beginning of this paragraph, mark at end.


13. C-h k C-g
	'C-g' signals a ‘quit’ condition.
	During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly.
	At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.

14. C-h t
    C-s yanking
	Reinsertion of killed text is called "yanking".  (Think of it
	as yanking back, or pulling back, some text that was taken away.)
	Generally, the commands that can remove a lot of text kill the text
	(they are set up so that you can yank the text), while the commands
	that remove just one character, or only remove blank lines and spaces,
	do deletion (so you cannot yank that text).

15. man ls
    -l list the files with a long listing format, doesn't include 
    files started with a dot
    dired displays a list of files in DIRNAME, including the files 
    started with a dot
