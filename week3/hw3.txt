1. 
Go back to the code of ls.c, we can find that "case_long_iso_time_style:"
is in a switch case.
Even if we don't delete it, the case of "long_iso_time_style" will still
be executed because of "case_long_iso_time_style" don't have a break in it.
However, we need to delete it because: First, it repeated. Second, the usage
of case with a underscore instead of a space is not right according to C++ 
coding style. It makes the code less messy.

2. 
In the original code, when assiging value to the array of long_time_format, 
it still involves some conditional decision. However, in the new codes, 
we just directly assign value to it, making it to the format of date 
in the States. It is possible that people in non-English countries 
cannot understand and thus causing some problems.

3. 
It will get an IndexError: list index out of range, because /dev/null is like
a trash bin for output, everything put in /dev/null just disappear. So, 
/dev/null is a empty file. If we want to get a line by index in a empty file,
it will get an IndexError

4. 
It gets a SyntaxError, saying 
  except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
This is beacuse in python3, syntax needs to be changed to 
'except IOError as err:'
