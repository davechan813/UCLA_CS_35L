1. 
	Connect my board to my mac book, connect to the wifi whose name is the id of the beaglebond
	Then configure the board to connect to my home's wifi.

2. 
	ssh to my beaglebone as root
	$ ssh root@192.168.8.1

4.
	I set a unique hostname for my partner to identify each other
	$ hostname dave
	$ hostname
	dave

5.
	I connect to my home's wifi.
	$ sudo connmanctl

	connmanctl> enable wifi
	Error wifi: Already enabled
	
	connmanctl> scan wifi
	Scan completed for wifi

	connmanctl> qiut

	Then I let my partner to connect to the same WIFI I am connecting to.

6. 
	Then I ask him to run ifconfig to know the ip address he is using.
	
	$ ifconfig

	SoftAp0   Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 60:64:05:19:1a:95  
          inet addr:192.168.8.1  Bcast:192.168.8.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
	...
	...
	wlan0     Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 2c:f7:f1:06:69:44  
	          inet addr:192.168.0.15  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
	          inet6 addr: fe80::2ef7:f1ff:fe06:6944/64 Scope:Link
	          inet6 addr: 2605:e000:8595:ec00:2ef7:f1ff:fe06:6944/64 Scope:Global
	          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST DYNAMIC  MTU:1500  Metric:1
	          RX packets:62 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
	          TX packets:126 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
	          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 
	          RX bytes:10847 (10.5 KiB)  TX bytes:24364 (23.7 KiB)
	So the ip address is 192.168.0.15

7.
	SSH into the root of my partner's board
	$ ssh root@192.168.0.13
	...
	...
	Last login: Sun Mar  4 00:14:35 2018 from 192.168.8.120
	root@bob:~# 

	It succeed and I logout
	$ exit
	logout
	Connection to 192.168.0.13 closed.

8.
	Then I created a new user and password for my partner to log on to my board
	$ useradd guestbob
	$ passwd guestbob
	Enter new UNIX password: 
	Retype new UNIX password: 
	passwd: password updated successfully

8.
	I also need to create a new hom direcotry for my partner
	$ mkdir /home/guestbob

	Then change the owner of the home directory
	$ chown guestbob /home/guestbob

	I also ask my partner to do the same thing so that I can log on his board

9.
	I then logged into my partner's board as a guest.
	$ ssh guest_dave@192.168.0.13
	Last login: Sat Mar  3 11:42:10 2018 from 192.168.3.104
	$ 

	It succeed and I logout
	$ exit
	logout
	Connection to 192.168.0.13 closed.

10.
	To ssh login without password, I first generate the public/private key pair
	$ ssh-keygen
	Generating public/private rsa key pair.
	Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): 
	/root/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
	Overwrite (y/n)? y
	Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
	Enter same passphrase again: 
	Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
	Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
	The key fingerprint is:
	d4:02:4c:27:30:47:7e:ee:a7:35:f9:a7:bc:cb:24:e7 root@dave
	The key's randomart image is:
	+---[RSA 2048]----+
	|    o=* .        |
	|     +.+ .       |
	|      . + .      |
	|       + .       |

	|        . * o    |
	|         + X  .  |
	|        .   E=   |
	+-----------------+

	Then I copied the public key to my partner's server
	$ ssh-copy-id guest_dave@192.168.0.13
	/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
	/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys

	BeagleBoard.org Debian Image 2016-06-14

	Support/FAQ: http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack_Debian

	default username:password is [debian:temppwd]

	guest_dave@192.168.0.13's password: 

	Number of key(s) added: 1

	Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'guest_dave@192.168.0.13'"
	and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

	Then I used the ssh agent to remember the private key for me
	$ eval `ssh-agent`
	Agent pid 6329

	$ ssh-add
	Identity added: /root/.ssh/id_rsa (rsa w/o comment)

10.
	Then I tried to log in to my partner's board 
	$ ssh guest_dave@192.168.0.13
	...
	...
	Last login: Sun Mar  4 00:32:46 2018 from 192.168.0.15

	This time it doesn't ask me for the password.

11.
	Then I logout to my own board and relog-in with -X option to enable xterm
	$ ssh -X root@192.168.8.1

	Then I login to my partner's board with -X option
	$ ssh -X guest_dave@192.168.0.13

	Then I invoked xterm
	$ xterm

	And everything works fine.
